			You've seen enough horror movies to know that a chainsaw can really do some damage.<br> You grab it and make sure it has fuel, then get into position.<br> It enters the barn and begins to look for you. Just looking at it fills you with dread.<br> It walks right next to your hiding spot, and turns to look at the rest of the barn. With its back to you, you know now is the perfect time.<br> With as much strength as you can muster, you pull the chainsaw's starter rope. Nothing happens.<br> You pull it a second time, but instead of hearing the engine start, you hear something big and fast moving toward you.<br> It reaches you before you can pull the rope a third time. <br>
			In hindsight, a loud weapon that requires that much effort to start probably wasn't the best choice...
