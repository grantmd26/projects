		<p class='text-sepia amatic-font large-text'>
			The pitchfork seems like the most appropriate weapon to use in a barn. You grab its handle and get into your ambush spot.<br> It walks in the barn and surveys its surroundings. It slowly wanders in your direction, and you feel adrenaline and hatred pumping through you.<br> You know it's fast, but you will be faster.<br> When it is just a few feet from you, you run in its direction with the pitchfork pointed at it, like a jousting lance.<br> Before it can turn around to defend itself, you plunge the pitchfork into it and keep running until it is skewered onto a hay bale.<br> Seemingly dead, you're able to get your first real look at it.<br> As you walk out of the barn back to your house, you hope that its the last time you'll ever see it again...
