		<p class='text-sepia amatic-font large-text'>
			You grab the shotgun and get into position.<br> As it enters the dimly lit barn, you can just barely get a glimpse of what it looks like.<br> Just a couple more steps and it will get close enough for the maximum impact of the shotgun.<br> As it walks by your hiding spot you emerge, aim the gun at what appears to be its head, and pull the trigger.<br> A futile "click" causes it to turn around, fix its eyes on you, and take you out in one quick swipe. <br>
			You should have known that no responsible gun owner leaves their gun loaded...
			<h3 class='text-red nosifer-font large-text'> You are dead.</h3>
